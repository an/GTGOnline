The Web application is up and running ([link](https://gtgonline-parinporecha.rhcloud.com/))

I've written a sync backend for Getting Things Gnome! which syncs tasks with GTGOnline!
It uses REST API and the documentation can be found [here](http://gtgonline-parinporecha.rhcloud.com/api/api_docs/)

For bug reporting, please open an issue or contact the developer
